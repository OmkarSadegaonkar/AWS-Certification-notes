15. Group - place to store users
16. Policy - JSON to give access to groups
17. Origin - is origin of all files that CDN will distribute. S3/ EC2/ Elastic Load Balancer/ Route 53 
18. Distribution - CDN network - collection of Edge locations
	2 types
		1) Web distribution
		2) RTMP - for media streaming
19. EC2 - web service - provide resizable compute capacity - not serverless - its a server
	reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instance to minutes
	Pricing models
		1) On demand
		2) Reserved
		3) Spot - if terminated by EC2 not charged
		4) Dedicated hosts - physical
	EC2 Types - FIGHT DR MCPXZ AU
	Linux 22, Microsoft RDP 3389, Http 80, Https 443
20. EBS - 
	1) SSD - GP2, IO1
	2) Magnetic - ST1, SC1
21. Always design for failure
22. Load balancers
	1) Application LB - Layer 7 - intelligent decisions
	2) Network LB - extreme performance, static IP addressed
	3) Classic LB - low cost - for dev, test
23. RDS (SQL, OLTP) - Multiple AZ, Read replicas
24. Dynamo DB - NOSQL
25. Redshift OLAP - huge data
26. Elasticache - memcached & reds
27. Graph DB- Amazon Neptchune
28. DNS - Route 53 - global
29. Elastic Beanstalk - upload code, no worry about infra - both free - limited and not programmable
30. AWS cloud formation - helps to model and setup AWS resources so spend less, create template JSON - programmable and bigger
31. Global services - IAM, Route53, Cloudfront, SNS, SNS
32. On premises - Snowball, snowball edge, storage gateway, codedeploy, opsworks, IOT greengrass
33. Cloudwatch - monitor perofrmance, every 5 min by default, 1 min interval, all about performance
34. AWS systems manager - on each VM and EC2
35. EBS - Virtual hard disk in the cloud
36. File gateway - supports file interface - store in S3
37. EMR - process large data efficiently
